"I'm an entrepreneur building skills to create wealth across business, technology, and financial markets.

My journey spans frontend development, graphic design, and trading psychology. I believe in the power of disciplined execution, continuous learning, and building systems that scale.

Every project is an opportunity to push boundaries, challenge conventions, and create experiences that resonate.

I’m a versatile designer and entrepreneur building skills at the intersection of brand strategy and creative engineering. I don't just design websites; I craft meaningful digital experiences that help businesses stand out in a crowded market.
